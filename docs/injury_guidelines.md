# Common Swimming Injuries — Quick Notes
- Shoulder: prioritize technique, rotator cuff strength (ER/IR), scapular stability, and T-spine mobility.
- Knee (breaststroke): limit whip kick volume during pain; strengthen quads/hamstrings; check ankle/hip mobility.
- Lower back: core stability (anti‑extension/anti‑rotation); streamline posture; hip hinge mechanics.
